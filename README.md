# Vault-Project
This is a Public test Repo for ESP Flasher.

This Repo Contains a Alpha Version of the ESP Flasher Program developed by Donovan Goodwin (DGxInfinitY).
This version of ESP Flasher is unusable as of commiting this README.
This is built on
<code>Vala 0.34.8</code>
and
<code>Gtk3</code>
#Note#
If you are unable to open the executable, open it in a terminal after allowing execution permission, this will allow you to select run time, try in mode 1, modes 2, and 3 are similar but they do not work. This will be fixed in the next compiled binary.
