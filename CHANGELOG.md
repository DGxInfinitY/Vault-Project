# V0.3.1
Simple Bug Fix...
	Preparation for backend has begun, more functionality has been added in the executable.
	espflasher.vala has been modified with extra functions for the hooking into the Ui and backend.
		Inclusion of Granite library will help aid in adding functions and allowing me to quickly build the application.
	espflasher.ui has been updated with a few small Ui fixes as well as a new About Dialog that still needs implementing.
		If you could be of assistance in helping me get that working I'd be greatly appreciative...

# v0.3
New Ui enhancements, and code rework.
	espflasher.vala was changed to shorten as well as remove unused code.
	The Binary was compiled using the new version 0.3 vala code.
	And changes to the Ui have been committed to the espflasher.ui file.
		Ui enhancements include adding spacers, packing everything to make it look better,
		and adding better button, label, and list looks to the program.

# v0.2
Complete new redesign of Ui and program organization.
	New Ui development environment using Glade on elementary OS.
	New binary titled espflasher is now in use.
	Separate Ui file so that the main binary doesn't need to be built as often.


# v0.1
